This website's goal is to break many different kinds of usability guidelines to create the most frustrating, unusable, and inefficient website for users.

# Instructions
Your job is to bid on artwork on behalf of a 89-year old woman who doesn't know how to use the internet. Given a list of artworks and amount to bid, make sure you get all your bids in before the timer of 3 minutes runs out! These instructions are also given to users on the website directly.

# Cheatsheet
Here is a simple cheatsheet to help you guide through the website and be successful in bidding on artwork!
1. Make sure you read all the directions given on every single page, specifically the "Welcome to Art Gallery" page! It talks about how you only have 3 minutes to bid.
2. If you need a refresher on what art pieces to bid on and how much, the directions can be reopened if you click on the subheading text that says "Bidding for someone? Look at your instructions again." on the "Art Gallery" page. You can check the list of art to bid on again without having to exit the page or refresh.
3. On the bottom right hand corner of the page, you can see the timer. When it runs out of 3 minutes, you cannot make anymore bids! Although, you won't know if you don't scroll to the bottom, since there are no immediate pop-up alert messages. 
4. If you do happen to run out of time before finishing all your bids, you can reset the timer with the reset timer button at the bottom right hand corner.
